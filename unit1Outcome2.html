        <h2>[Outcome 2 - Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful]</h2>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed</h3>
        <p>So far I’m happy with the tools we as a class have been using. Although prior to this course, I had only used Sublime for writing HTML, VS Code has proven immensely useful for typing in a Python and HTML format. It also allows you to download add-ons and change themes, giving me the opportunity to understand the errors I am making more clearly, and reading the code easier due to the colour theme.</p>

        <p>Although overall I was happy with VS Code and the languages taught, using only HTML and CSS for our website design was difficult. My original approach to the website involved trying to use pure CSS to get the portions of large text to slide up under the question title. The most efficient way to code this would be via additional languages such as Javascript, and as I do not know this language yet, I decided to change my approach and keep the text on show.</p>
            
        <p>Trello has been a very helpful tool throughout the course. On the group project, we were able to keep track of and prioritise our tasks, getting the story down much quicker than anticipated, which left us with plenty of time to finish our code. For the individual project, I kept using Trello to keep track of the questions and answers yet to tackle, as well as the general website building checklist. Having it in a Trello board also makes it an effective backup if anything ever happens to my text documents, which I use to start with typing up my thoughts before transferring them to VS Code or Trello.</p>
            
        <p>Draw.io was a useful tool for visualising my thought process during both game design and website projects. During game design we were able to utilise the flowchart created via draw.io to create our story board and follow it when creating our code, without confusing ourselves on what functions should deliver what result. During the web design project, I was able to visualise my thoughts for the pathing of the website. Using the diagram both for and in the website pages. However, after reviewing all of the questions set for the written work, I decided to change my approach to the website layout, choosing to instead create drop down links for the navigation bar for each separate outcome in Unit 1.</p>
            
        <p>Other tools used throughout the course were Slack, Zoom and GitHub. Slack was extremely effective as a communication tool, both for reaching out to team members, as well as getting my instructor to review my written work/code. Zoom was also helpful in communicating my bugs in the code, as I was able to share my screen for others to review the code with a different perspective. GitHub was helpful in being able to find open source code, and to understand how others have chosen to write their code in similar circumstances.</p>

        <p>Overall, I am very confident with the tools I have used, but deeper learning and further research would make these tools even more helpful in the future.</p>


        <br>
        <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h3>
        <p>To reiterate, Trello has been a useful way to pop depositing the various portions of the Unit outcomes, and its relevance to the website is somewhat limited, but the website is handy as a background tool if any information becomes corrupted, gets muddled etc.</p>
        
        <p>That doesn’t mean however that I’ve relied on pasting different types of Syntax into there at this moment in time (although thinking about it now the prospect is appealing, it’d act as a quick place to give each form of syntax context if I ever get confused with some of what I’m typing in the future.</p>
            
        <p>VS Code, to put it simply, is a lifesaver; Sublime was the last programme I used to play around with some basic HTML, both back in school and university and in comparison VS Code is lightyears ahead with it’s handy repository or terms, terminal, and ability to save multiple file types. I cannot begin to tell you how useful it is to be able to actually see what’s wrong with my webpage instead of playing a 2 hour guessing game trying to spot what went wrong. The tool’s dark-mode has proven useful for the eyes as well, eye strain seems to come to me easier if I’m looking at dark text on a white background, so the Dark-mode has given me a few hours of additional comfort in the class. Overall I’d say both have been appropriate tools to use for this project. Trello being the non-essential, but a good idea to keep handy, and VS Code being the absolute must for building something quickly and effectively.</p>


        <br>
        <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h3>
        <p>So far I'm relatively happy with the website I designed. The current version of the website is very basic, but this is due to the fact that I have only been learning HTML and CSS for 3 days, and at that, still a very basic understanding of both languages. The layout is simple, with a dark background and readable font in shades of white. I was able to incorporate :hover functionality in blue and yellow, and after testing this colour scheme on a friend with a rare version of deuteranopia colour vision, and he was still able to differentiate the hover colours from the original white shades. Although I realise this is not a full-proof test for all colourblind people, for a project of this type, I still consider this a strength for my website.</p>
        
        <p>However, accessibility as a whole, can be improved on this website. I have provided alt text for all images used, but I have yet to implement text-to-speech functionality on my website. As I only know very basic HTML and CSS, it is not something I was able to include, and if a person with vision impairment were to use the website as is, they would not be able to access the information on my website freely. This is definitely a weakness I hope to amed in the future.</p>
        
        <p>Another strength of the website is the simplicity of structure. The each web page follows the structure of:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Social media links</li>
                <li>Main heading</li>
                <li>Navigation bar</li>
                <li>Code nation project logo</li>
                <li>Heading 2 for outlining outcome objective</li>
                <li>Headings 3 for outlining the question</li>
                <li>Paragraphs to answer above question</li>
                <li>References with links</li>
                <li>Social media links</li>
            </ol>
        <p>By using this structure on every page, I have achieved consistency and clarity for the website. As this was my original concept, I am glad I was able to bring it to fruition.</p>

        <p>One weakness for my website would be the large amount of text that the reader will have to scrolls though. My original plan involved a slide up button next to each heading 3 question, so the reader had the option to hide the text and open it back up when needed. I wanted to achieve this through pure CSS code. Upon further research into this website function, I realised that the easier way would have been through the use of either Javascript or Bootstrap. Unfortunately, these languages are unfamiliar to me right now, and I didn’t want to just copy and paste the code in, without learning/understanding what it is I have done. Thus, I had to change my approach, and leave the text on show, and hoping the website user doesn’t mind scrolling through. The long body of text will remain, in my eyes, a weakness for this website design.</p>

        <p>However, what I have managed to achieve is still impressive in my eyes. My plan is to return to this website once I have done more learning into other programming languages, to see if I may improve upon the current design.</p>


        <br>
        <h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
        <p>As mentioned previously, accessibility is certainly something I would look to improve on this and future projects. My constraint on this occasion is lack of experience - had I had more understanding of how to utilise javascript or bootstrap to enable a text-to-speech function, it would have made the website a lot more accessible for users with vision impairment.</p> 
        
        <p>Another function I was not able to implement due to my lack of knowledge, was the slide up and slide down functions for the large bodies of text on the outcome 1, 2 and 3 pages. An improvement would have been to include a button next to every question heading, which upon pressing, reveals hidden text, and once revealed, the same button would also be able to hide the text once more, under the question headline. This was one of my biggest frustrations for this website, as it makes it a lot more difficult to digest such a large piece of text. I know that I prefer to compartmentalise large amounts of information in order to take it all in, and I’m concerned that this could impact ease-of-use for other such learners.</p>
        
        <p>Therefore, in order to make further improvements to my website, as well as any future digital projects, I need to further improve upon my own experience and knowledge of programming languages. Javascript in particular, due to its universality and popularity, would be the programming language I focus on in the future.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
        <p>As far as my original requirements, I did have to change the website layout, to accommodate the unit 2 written work, but overall, the structure, colour scheme and quality of work remained in accordance with the original plan.</p>
        
        <p>To keep track of my own ideas and progress I used Trello, outlining each question and answer, as well as the web design checklist. Throughout the website building, once a page was completed, I would refresh the page in the browser to see whether the intended design appeared, and to test for any errors. Once the HTML pages were created, I followed each page from top to bottom while creating the relevant CSS code. This helped me to stay on top of my set tasks, while also completing almost all of the functions of the intended website design.</p>
        
        <p>The biggest issues for me was to correct the error with cousin the #ID CSS to show up in browser, implement a slide up/slide down button, and make the website text-to-speech friendly. Although I was only back to tackle the former due to time and experience constraints, the overall website is fit for purpose.</p>

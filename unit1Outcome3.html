        <h2>Outcome 3 - Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems</h2>
        
        <br>
        <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h3>
        <p>In terms of software, Slack and Zoom have been the most efficient tools for me in terms of communication and managing productivity. In my previous employment, we had only ever used windows teams for communicating and thus it took some initial getting used to these new separate functions for staying in touch with the course material, as well as the rest of the course cohort. But once I understood the basic functions, it was easy to reach out via Slack to both my instructor and my fellow students to get their opinion on my code via screen sharing on Zoom. Instead of spending time trying to email and include screenshots of the code and what it should be doing, I would be able to explain my problem live on screen, for my peers or instructor to give an external point of view for solutions or more efficient ways of coding. This took a lot less time than what it would have taken to construct the email, send it, await for a response and then continue a back and forth until a solution was found.</p>

        <p>Where I could have been more productive, was with the way I chose to write out the answers to my questions. At the time of writing this, I am using Google Docs to create a word document, and once I am happy with the answer, I will then download a copy of the questions as a word or PDF doc and send it to the instructor for final review, before copying and pasting the text into the corresponding HTML page in VS Code. The process continues from there, as I also then have to format the text with additional <strong>< br ></strong> tags and break up into individual <strong>< p ></strong> sections to make the large piece of text more palatable for the website user.</p>

        <p>This process could have been made shorter if I simply started writing the answer in the HTML code, formatting as I wrote out a new paragraph. However, after going through GCSEs, A Levels, and a 4 year BA degree, I know that my learning process involves writing out all of my thoughts onto a black piece of (virtual) paper, before formatting it into a coherent piece of written work. It is how I learn and although, yes, the work could have been reduced, I got more learning of the subject matter, understanding of concepts and better self reflection by going through the word processing software first. Thus, I do not see this as time wasted.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
        <p>Firstly, you need to actually be in the mindset to do what you need to do. You can have as much research as possible on a topic or project, but confidence in what you’re about to tackle can impact your motivation to actually do it. Come to terms with the fact that it’s a learning process and be willing to try and resolve the problem yourself or with the aid of someone else. It is one of the first lessons taught to software developers - prepare to fail.</p>

        <p>Something else that can be helpful (or otherwise!) is the company you keep. It took many years to learn this, but work to gravitate towards those you’re comfortable with, as long as you’re sure you can work and talk in tandem - excessive conversation is definitely a productivity killer. With that in mind, ignoring distractions is a key discipline to teach yourself. Sometimes you might be near a disruptive person, and the best thing you can do is keep your head turned to your machine and concentrate.</p>

        <p>Research always promotes productivity. It is easy to finish your day and then sit on the sofa all evening (especially in current times) until you’re ready to come in on the following day but more often than not if you’re in a learning environment and happen to be privy to what you’ll be learning in the next days or coming weeks doing some minor reading on the subject can help prepare you better for what’s to come. I already had some working knowledge of HTML a little before coming here so I haven’t had as many issues to work with than I probably would have. But as I didn’t know anything about Python, I decided to read up on the terminology, to make sure I would understand what a function or a loop means when it comes to the lessons.  Generally my productivity in the website's production pace revolved around experimenting with new functions, such as drop down menu on a navigation bar.</p>

        <p>Most importantly, don’t assume you’ve understood the topic you just went over once. In a teaching session, even when you think you understand the topic at hand it’s still better to listen and reabsorb the information as it might have some contextual relevance to later topics, which you won’t understand if you didn’t listen. Making notes along with the instructor can also solidify your understanding of a subject, especially if you are able to use your own words to describe the topic in a way you’ll understand when going back to your notes.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h3>
        <p>As this is my first website, which focuses on my own journey through learning to code, I don’t feel that team work would have been an appropriate solution. This is a very personal project and it would not make sense to have multiple people’s input on how I felt throughout the learning process.</p>

        <p>However, had this been a website relating to our game design project, it would have been an excellent idea to have everyone submit a page for the website, relaying their own responsibilities and the overall result - the game code.</p>

        <p>In terms of IT solutions, I would definitely improve my productivity by learning more HTML and CSS shortcuts. It would also be beneficial in the long term to learn Javascript. For the navigation bar and the drop down menu, I used pure CSS in this project. It would have saved me a lot of time (and headaches) had I known the appropriate javascript code for the same function.</p>

        <p>Productivity also improves through the simple act of practice. The more you repeat an action, or the more you repeat code, the easier it becomes to repeat this action in the future. I already found myself making full use of the fact that we have been coding once a day, for 3 weeks straight during this course. Like any foreign language, programming takes practice and repetition to solidify your understanding of the programming language you are writing in.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
        <p>In the instance of the website project, I had the index.html file opened throughout the process of writing the HTML and CSS code. This was for two reasons:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>To keep the CSS in order of appearance on the screen.</li>
                <li>Continuous testing of newly written code.</li>
            </ol>
        <p>With the page open, I was able to logically and clearly path the code, as well as format the text with appropriately sized font and colour. It became so routine that I would ctrl+S and immediately refresh the page to see the result. This helped me realise bugs before I moved on to other pieces of code, which meant I had peace of mind when linking pages together with clean code. </p>

        <p>VS Code was excellent for testing this digital project, as it would indicate errors before I would even save the code. I recently downloaded an addon called Error Lens, which places the error message on the exact line of code, while underlining the exact character (or lack thereof) in the code that is causing the bug. Much like a word processor notifies you of spelling errors.</p>

        <p>The final testing came once I uploaded the project to a new repository on GitHub. Upon publishing the site, and using the new address in my browser, I realised that one of my social media links, funnily enough the GitHub profile link, was not updated to the new hyperlink. I also uploaded this website link to our cohort Slack channel for my fellow students to review, and one of them was able to spot the same error. This was a very easy fix, and I appreciated my friend pointing out the error as well, as it confirmed that it wasn’t a browser issue, but was in fact, an error in the href. </p>

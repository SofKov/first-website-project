        <br>
        <h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
        <p>2020 put many things in perspective, and none more so than the technology available to us. IT has played an integral role in every industry, from allowing friends and loved ones to maintain contact, to continuing the education of future generations.</p>
        
        <p>The way business is approaching IT is constantly changing, with organisations leaning on IT to renovate the workforce, improve processes, achieve cost efficiencies, drive revenue growth and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.</p>
        
        <p>IT departments have also evolved, becoming the linchpin of agile organizations. Companies like Salesforce have turned this to their advantage, creating software which allows for continuity among marketing, sales and customer service<a id="jump" href="#ref">[1]</a>.</p>
        
        <p>IT is at the core of internal operating models essential for globalization, such as telecommuting and outsourcing. Companies will use network technologies to stay in contact with overseas employees from non-core functions, such as human resources and finances.</p>
        
        <p>Similarly, companies will also use IT for effective stakeholder engagement. Information stored on servers based in headquarters in one country can be accessed by the marketing department from a different country, in order to communicate with their shareholders on a global scale.</p> 
        
        <p>From small businesses run by a single person to huge multinational corporations, workplaces cannot function without IT. It is used across every department and is a vital part of business operations in the modern age.</p>
        
        <p>Ada Lovelace would have been proud to find that her predictions of computers being used for more than mathematical calculations were accurate<a id="jump" href="#ref">[2]</a>.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3>
        <p>Project management methods, tools and skills are required from all team members to ensure risks are eliminated, the digital project is completed on time and within budget.</p> 
        
        <p>First and foremost, structure is needed to ensure all team members are clear on assigned duties and critical deadlines. Gantt charts, trello and kanban boards are all methods of visualising the project cycle and estimating task duration<a id="jump" href="#ref">[3]</a>. It is useful to divide tasks into relevant categories and update each task progress through until it can be marked as ‘completed’. This would also be a good time to identify task dependencies for your digital project, where relevant, such as ensuring that you have the relevant hardware and software, like VS Code, in order to complete the project.</p>
        
        <p>If the project involves numerous team members, communication and teamwork skills are vital and will enable the team to share knowledge and build a stronger project together. If the team is working together remotely, video conference software, such as Zoom, is an effective way of maintaining clarity among the team, in terms of task deadlines and requiring assistance with code or design, if needed.</p>
        
        <p>Another crucial component of digital projects is resources. Resourcing and finding information ahead of time will save you from spending hours trying to find it when you should be focusing on completing a newly set task. If the digital project in question has specific terms set by the client, it is useful to find information on how to put those terms into effect. Instead of spending hours trying to overcome a bug in your code, it would be more efficient to look through online forums to see if the problem has previously been encountered and/or solved by others in your field.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, important to digital projects, and especially a project involving a form of code development, is at least a basic understanding of how to navigate your system. If problems arise during the project, and you don’t know where to save or find your files, tracking an error could become a lengthy process. If the project involves you using a system you’re unfamiliar with, it is helpful to use the “help” option of said application to figure out shortcut controls, and possible functions. If you are working in a team, your fellow team members are another valuable source of knowledge, as all experiences differ and this always opens opportunities for learning.</p>
        
        <p>Continuous review of progress, budget and deadlines will ensure all parties are delivering on the agreed terms of the project and contract with the client.</p>
        
        <p>Once a project has been completed, a follow up meeting would yield important feedback on points for improvement, as well as potential for securing a repeat business if the client is satisfied with the results.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website.</h3>
        
        <p>I was originally planning on designing a website that addressed the groom’s point of view of planning a wedding, as it was a topic on which there is currently little content other than “what suit to wear”. However, upon further thought, and after attending a lecture about content creation, I now find it more appropriate to dedicate this website to my own journey through learning to code. As the subject matter for the website is already decided, the practical aspects are next.</p>
        
        <p>My initial plan for making my own website is to research for similar websites, with a similar subject matter for a blog about learning to code. I will be looking for websites with a clean aesthetic to draw inspiration from. Other research points will include deciding on an appropriate colour scheme, font type and initial layout of the final build.</p>
        
        <p>I will use a Trello board to keep track of the initial tasks, while compiling a mind map for the website in draw.io<a id="jump" href="#ref">[4]</a>. The mind map will be focused on pathing rather than visual design, although design will remain a major component of the project.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h3>
        <p>Something that applies not only to digital projects, but to most tasks with deadlines, is cohesion. In terms of group projects, clear and continuous communication ensures that all team members remain on the right course, and don’t deviate from the overall vision. In personal experience, lack of planning sessions and not returning to the agreed plan can lead to individuals distracting themselves with ideas outside of the project. This in turn damaged the progress and caused frustration among the team, reducing overall performance.</p> 
        
        <p>A common cause of digital projects failing is improper file pathing<a id="jump" href="#ref">[5]</a>. Saving under a wrong name, incorrect spelling or even a wrong folder altogether will delay the project, as you struggle to retrieve the relevant data files, or import them into your code. Speaking of system use, server or system failures occurring during unsaved working can unmake a lot of work for an individual or an entire team. Backups are crucial to minimising and/or avoiding this risk altogether, but due to the nature of the online world, your backup location needs to be secure from cyber threats, as data breaches could be fatal to the project funding, client relationship and future reputation of the business.</p>
        
        <p>Funding and budget management can be a deciding factor in a digital (or any other kind of) project<a id="jump" href="#ref">[6]</a>. If a client is no longer satisfied with the performance due to the issues raised above, funding could be pulled, and entire months, or even years worth of work could go unpaid. If the project is being fulfilled by a smaller business, this could be extremely damaging, especially if the funding is continuous.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
        <p>Firstly, I would determine what my objective is for the IT system or software I need<a id="jump" href="#ref">[7]</a> - if I am a sales manager, I need a customer relationship management(CRM) software that is capable of tracking the entire sales process, from collating a leads pipeline, to sending out a contract to “seal the deal”.</p>
        
        <p>Secondly, I would use the objectives as a starting point for making a list of requirements<a id="jump" href="#ref">[7a]</a>. What functionality does this CRM software actually need to have? What level of ease-of-use do we require in order to make training of new recruits easier (keyboard shortcuts, how many click-throughs to achieve one task etc)? Do you need this to run on both Windows and Mac operating systems? Is there a need to sync with other software, such as emails, calendar, LinkedIn? If budget is key, what are we, as a business, willing to invest into the initial set up and will we be able to hire anyone to maintain the software?</p>
        
        <p>Thirdly, I would use the above requirements list and start an initial search using search engines like Google or Bing, in order to see if a software that meets this criteria already exists. If it does not, do we have the budget to hire a developer to design a new system from scratch? Or do we compromise on some of the criteria in the short term?</p>
        
        <p>Once a list of potential software has been identified, begin the testing and negotiation phase<a id="jump" href="#ref">[8]</a>. Software/solution providers usually provide a demonstration of their product or offer a free trial to potential clients. Not only is it budget-friendly, but there is no pressure to commit to a product, allowing you to do your research in the right way.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, consider the long-term impact of choosing a new IT system or software<a id="jump" href="#ref">[8a]</a>. The implementation period will potentially involve a lot of disruption to day-to-day business, as data migration will most likely be an arduous task for your team. As mentioned previously, you also need to consider continuous investment into your system to ensure it continues to serve and adapt to your business goals.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</h3>
        <p>For our game design project, the team made good use of Trello, but we did not use all the features it had to offer. As project manager of the team, it was on me to set the tasks, which we typed in manually, setting labels to colour code the level of priority to get said task done. All of our code was shared in Slack, and instead of commenting on tasks, we addressed the issues directly via Zoom, either during the morning stand ups, or as soon as they would arise.</p> 
        
        <p>However, Trello was a useful tool for visualising the entire project cycle from start to completion, which did make task delegation a lot simpler. Although we didn’t set any automatic deadlines for tasks, I maintained order of the board by updating the completed tasks daily.</p>
        
        <p>As I don’t have a large amount of experience with git or GitHub, from what I have experienced, I hope that both tools will help with presenting the project in a clear, user-friendly way. Git in particular would have been helpful on the game design project, as it would have allowed for collaborative fluidity among the team. We would have been able to revert to previous versions of the code and track changes in order to understand where new bugs were coming up and what changes in the code caused them. Code version control is something we should have utilised to save time, instead we relied on one person making all changes to one piece of code while sharing their screen with us on a Zoom call<a id="jump" href="#ref">[9]</a>.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h3>
        <p>Until 2018, there was little guidance for digital projects on legal constraints. Companies were able to use customer data without providing clarity on how said data would be used in the future and for how long it would be stored on their servers. This changed in 2018 with the introduction of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)<a id="jump" href="#ref">[10]</a> - legislation which regulates the processing of personal data in the EU. Although GDPR applies within the EU, companies from other countries wishing to do business within the EU will also have to comply in accordance with the legislation. GDPR has transformed the way digital projects have to be conducted around the globe in numerous ways.</p>
        
        <p>Firstly, it regulates how companies store data. Teams working on digital projects are required, by law, to ensure that their purpose for storing data is reduced to the absolute minimum. This applies cross-departmentally - collecting email information is useful for marketing teams as well as sales functions.</p>
        
        <p>Secondly, the ban on automated decision-making now means that digital marketing teams are no longer allowed to apply algorithms to drive and target ads. To ensure this, any entities that collect data, must demonstrate compliance with the regulations.</p>
        
        <p>The impacts of non-compliance are numerous. If a company fails to implement appropriate security measures to protect the data, it could face fines of up to €20 million, or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover. For small and medium sized enterprises, this could result in the collapse of their venture. Reputation will also be damaged, potentially putting off new customers, resulting in less resources for future projects.</p>
        
        <p>GDPR creates new obligations and expenses for digital projects, but it does protect and regulate how users are being tracked in the confusing and vast space of data.</p>
